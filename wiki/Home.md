# Welcome to A Simple Ktx Game

This tutorial is based on the [A Simple Game](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game) game from the original LibGDX wiki.
The idea is to demonstrate a small example of how that game could look like in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) using [LibKTX](https://github.com/libktx) which contains Kotlin extensions for LibGDX games and applications.

It should give you a good starting point for developing your own games in the future using LibGDX and Kotlin.

This tutorial **will not** explain LibGDX or Kotlin basics. I will assume that you have already some basic knowledge meaning that you already read the **A Simple Game** tutorial and also, that you already have at least a little understanding and experience with Kotlin.

If you are interested, please check out the **Table of Contents**. It is sorted from top to bottom to guide you through step by step.
